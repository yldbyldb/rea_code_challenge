# REA UI developer test

>This code is for the REA coding challenge. All of the data (JSON object) is from a mock backend.

### Features

1. Display the list of properties using the data set within the “results" array running down the page in a column that has a heading labeled Results. 
2. There will be a second column with a heading Saved Properties, along side the Results column. It will contain the initial property within the “saved" array.
3. Hovering over a property card in the Results column will display an ’add’ button. Clicking the ‘add’ button will create the property in the Saved Properties column. Hovering over a property card in the Saved Properties column will display a 'remove’ button. 
4. Clicking the ‘remove' button will remove the property from the list of saved properties.

### Requirements

1. Code separated into Modules where appropriate. (AMD/Commonjs/ES6) etc.
2. Logical sequence of commits so we can see how you came to the solution.
3. Testing, (Capturing the business logic of the above requirements) or at the very least around the adding and removing of data.
4. Instructions on building the project and some documentation.
